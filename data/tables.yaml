  9: ['Reclaimers', 'You started out on the road, but then moved into one of the deserted ghost towns or cities to rebuild it. A pioneer life: dangerous, but with plenty of simple food and a safe place to sleep. You were home schooled if there was anyone who had the time.']
  10: ['Edgerunners', 'Your home was always changing based on your parents current "job". Could be a luxury apartment, an urban conapt, or a dumpster if you were on the run. Food and shelter ran the gamut from gourmet to kibble.']
