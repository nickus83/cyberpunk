  3: ['Corporate Technicians', 'Middle-middle class, with comfortable conapts or Beaverville suburban homes, minivans and corporate-run technical schools. Kind of like living 1950s America crossed with 1984.']
  4: ['Nomad Pack', 'You had a mix of rugged trailers, vehicles, and huge road kombis for your home. You learned to drive and fight at an early age, but the family was always there to care for you. Food was actually fresh and abundant. Mostly home schooled.']
  5: ['Ganger"s', 'A savage, violent home in any place the gang could take over. You were usually hungry, cold, and scared. You probably did not know who your actual parents were. Education? The Gang taught you how to fight, kill, and steal—what else did you need to know?']

  9: ['Reclaimers', 'You started out on the road, but then moved into one of the deserted ghost towns or cities to rebuild it. A pioneer life: dangerous, but with plenty of simple food and a safe place to sleep. You were home schooled if there was anyone who had the time.']
  10: ['Edgerunners', 'Your home was always changing based on your parents current "job". Could be a luxury apartment, an urban conapt, or a dumpster if you were on the run. Food and shelter ran the gamut from gourmet to kibble.']
