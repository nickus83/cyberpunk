Welcome to my amateur project for the "Cyberpunk Red" tabletop game! Please note that this project is for personal and educational purposes only, and is not intended for commercial use.

This project generates randomly character features included personal life goals, tnemies family an so on.

This project currently includes classes for Fixer, Media, Exec and Rockerboy characters. Not included (for now) their associated abilities and equipment. Please feel free to use this project for your own tabletop games or as a reference for learning about character creation in Cyberpunk Red.

Please note that the Solo, Netrunner, Tech, Medtech, Lawmen and Nomad class has not yet been implemented, but may be added in the future. Additionally, any feedback or contributions to this project are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for checking out my project, and happy gaming!

It is planned to export this project into a PDF format for easier access and reference. Stay tuned for updates on when this feature will be available.
